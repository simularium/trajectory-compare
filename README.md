## Preparing Images
Hopefully someday this workflow will be automated, but for now the manual steps:

1. Take full screen screenshots of the trajectories to be compared, all in the same sized window, and with the desired time and other visualization settings. 
2. In Photoshop, choose `File > Scripts > Load files into stack...`, browse to select all the screenshots (Don't enable any alignment or smart object options) and choose `OK`.
3. Crop the files as desired.
4. Name the layers by the parameter values for each.
5. Choose `File > Export > Layers to files...`, select a sub directory in the `img/` directory as the destination, set the prefix to the experiment name, select JPEG output type and choose `Run`.
6. Run the Python script to fix the names generated by Photoshop. In terminal: 
```bash
cd [path/to/this/repo]
python rename_imgs.py img/[path/to/sub/dir]
```
7. Update `data.js` with the new dataset.
